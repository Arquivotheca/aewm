.SH "NAME"
aewm \- An Exiguous Window Manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B aewm
.I [options...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B aewm
is an X11 window manager with very few features. It draws a small
titlebar above top-level windows, allows you to manipulate them with the
mouse, and starts other programs when the root window is clicked. That's
also about all it does, so don't expect anything nifty.
.PP
The titlebar contains a small box in the upper right corner. Clicking
the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd buttons on the main area of the titlebar will
raise, move, or lower the window, respectively. Clicking on the box will
respectively hide, resize, or close the window.
.PP
By default, clicking on the root window with button 1 will run
.BR aemenu (1x),
and button 3 will start a new
.BR xterm (1x),
and and button 2 will run
.BR "aemenu \-\-switch" .
.B aemenu
(or another equivalent program) is required to unhide hidden windows;
.B aewm
does not do this itself.
